# AppleStockAnalysis
Simple analysis of the AAPL Stock when compared to the S&amp;P 500 performance over the past year making use of Python, DataFrames, Pandas, and Yahoo Finance Data.

Pulling the past year of data for the ticket SPY and AAPL shows a clear correlation but as noted in the notebook, since AAPL is a part of the S&P 500 and the companies within it are not
equally weighted, it does make sense that they are by default related to some extent but the S&P including many other companies does help show the trend of the market.

Near the conclusion, the end result was essentially a foundation that showed that based on the health performance of the stock, AAPL would be a comfortable hold long term despite 
the possibility of some short term volatility that may occur. Additionally, if a stock option were to be purchased, based on the past week worth of data (Current Date 02/05/2024) then a strike price for a Call Option between $195 and $199 would be solid with an expiriation varying but ideally within the next few weeks. (Initially scoped 1 month for the chart, but updated to the past two weeks for a more recent view)

Quick analysis to showcase the usage of Python and relevant libraries and datasets via Pandas and Yahoo Finance in an applicable financial setting.
